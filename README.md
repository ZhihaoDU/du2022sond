The inference pipeline has been released in FunASR repository (https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/FunASR) including model structures and forward function. And, the pre-trained model has been released at ModelScope (https://www.modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_diarization_sond-zh-cn-alimeeting-16k-n16k4-pytorch/summary). The training related codes are under developement.
You can read FunASR/egs/alimeeting/diarization/sond/README.md for more details.

Hello guys, good news!!! After our efforts on internal code review,
- The code will be released by March with FunASR repository (https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/FunASR)
- The pre-trained diarization model will be released at ModelScope(https://www.modelscope.cn/models) at the same time. 
- By the way, the pre-trained speaker embedding model has already been released at https://www.modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_xvector_sv-zh-cn-cnceleb-16k-spk3465-pytorch/summary.
